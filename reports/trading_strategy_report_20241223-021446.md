**Trading Plan:**

- **Latest Price Data:** $94,131.66 (2024-12-23 02:14:00)
  
- **Entry Point:** $94,000  
  The entry point is set at $94,000 based on the current price action and anticipated bullish trend driven by the recent news regarding innovative AI developments in Web3 and the consistent interest in established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Monero. 

- **Exit Point:** $95,000  
  The exit point aims for a $1,000 profit per unit traded, considering the prevailing market sentiment still leaning towards 'greed' and the potential surge in user-friendly applications which could lead to increased trading volumes.

- **Stop-Loss Levels:** $93,000  
  The stop-loss is positioned at $93,000 to mitigate risks in case of a sudden downturn, allowing approximately a $1,000 risk per unit. This provides a favorable risk-reward ratio while safeguarding against extreme market fluctuations.

- **Suggested Trade Size:** 5% of total capital  
  Allocating only 5% of total capital limits exposure while allowing room to capitalize on favorable market conditions without risking overall portfolio integrity.

- **Expected Risks:**  
  The primary risks include volatility stemming from geopolitical factors and evolving regulatory environments, particularly related to new EU regulations on USDT which may impact liquidity and lead to sudden price corrections. The recent NFT fraud case also poses a risk to overall market confidence, which could affect trading sentiment negatively.

**Risk Management Strategy:**  
- Diversification: Maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate individual asset risk.  
- Regular Monitoring: Stay updated on news that may influence market sentiment including regulatory developments and technological advancements that could create new trading opportunities.  
- Emotional Discipline: Stick to the predetermined exit and stop-loss points to avoid emotional trading decisions during periods of high volatility.

By implementing this strategy, I aim to capitalize on the current market conditions and emerging trends while maintaining a prudent risk management approach.
