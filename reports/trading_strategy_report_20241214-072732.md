**Finalized Trading Plan Based on Current Trends and Market Conditions**

1. **Market Momentum Analysis**:
   - Given the positive momentum in altcoins, particularly with Sui reaching an all-time high (ATH) and XRP targeting $5, I advise looking for short-term trading opportunities on these altcoins. Allocate a portion of your capital, approximately 5% of your trading capital, to actively trade Sui and XRP over the next few days while maintaining a strict risk management approach.

2. **Ethereum Strategy**:
   - Institutional inflows into Ethereum ETFs signal a bullish trend for ETH. Consider strengthening your positions in ETH by increasing allocations by 10% of your trading capital. Entry points should be considered around new institutional activity announcements or price dips, targeting areas where significant trading volume is observed.

3. **Regulatory Environment**:
   - Stay updated on SEC and CFTC regulations as they may incite volatility across the crypto space. Maintain flexibility in your portfolio and be prepared to quickly reallocate assets in response to regulatory news. Keep a 5% reserve cash position from your trading capital to exploit sudden opportunities that may emerge.

4. **Stablecoin Yield Strategy**:
   - With the growth of USDC, assess the possibility of allocating 15% of your trading capital into liquidity pools that utilize USDC. This can enhance yield farming opportunities and provide a more stable return within your portfolio.

5. **Risk Management for Bitcoin**:
   - With potential sell-offs from major BTC holders likely, set your stop-loss order at 100700.00, which is approximately 6.01% of your trading capital, to mitigate risks associated with BTC price fluctuations. Furthermore, consider employing hedging strategies using options or inverse ETFs.

6. **Monitoring Political Influence**:
   - Watch developments in South Koreaâ€™s political landscape as they could indirectly influence local investment sentiment towards cryptocurrencies. Allocate time to daily news reviews and set alerts for political updates that could impact market direction.

**Trading Parameters**:
- **Entry Price for BTC**: 101301.07
- **Targets for BTC**: 
  - 1st Target: 102000.00 (Take Profit at 20% of position)
  - 2nd Target: 102650.00 (Take Profit at remaining 80% of position)
- **Stop-Loss Placement**: 100700.00
- **Trade Size**: Allocate 10% of total trading capital for this trade.
- **Overall Risk Assessment**: Acknowledge that with this strategy, the risk is approximately 6.01% of your trading capital based on stop-loss settings.

**Conclusion**:
By leveraging the insights from market momentum, institutional movements in Ethereum, vigilance regarding regulatory developments, alongside strategic stablecoin utilization, and prudent risk management, we position ourselves well within the current landscape. It is essential to remain agile and responsive to emerging news and market conditions to optimize trade outcomes.
