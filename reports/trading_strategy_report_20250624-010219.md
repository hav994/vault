3. **Institutional Confidence in ETH**: Despite chaos, Ethereum‚Äôs ninth straight week of inflows ($124M) signals institutional accumulation during dips8.  
4. **Altcoin Fragility**: XRP and SOL underperformed BTC, highlighting higher risk in low-cap assets during volatility512.  

‚Ä¢Note: Monitor Iran‚Äôs response and U.S. economic data (Fed Chair Powell testimony today) for directional cues. BTC $99K is critical support; breach may trigger cascading liquidations.‚Ä¢
