**Critical Insights:**  
- **Geopolitical Risks:** BTC‚Äôs resilience below $100K (defended twice in 12h) signals institutional accumulation. High-impact news requires monitoring Middle East developments.  
- **Institutional Demand:** $1.24B weekly inflows (CoinShares) underscore bullish conviction despite panic. ETH‚Äôs 9-week inflow streak ($124M) reinforces strength.  
- **XRP Catalyst:** Legal clarity expected by August 2025; 95% ETF approval odds (Bloomberg) could ignite breakout. Current consolidation near $2.00‚Äì$2.08 support ideal for accumulation.  
- **Security Breaches:** Front-end hacks highlight phishing risks but lack direct coin impact. Isolate trading decisions from non-fundamental FUD.  

**Technical Strategy:**  
- **BTC:** Daily chart shows bull flag forming; reclaiming $102,000 (12h VWAP) confirms uptrend. Buy zones: $99K‚Äì$100.5K.  
- **ETH:** Holding $2,200 support (0.236 Fib) with RSI 42. Break above $2,300 targets $2,500.  
- **XRP:** Oversold RSI 44 on 12h; breakout above $2.10 with volume signals entry. Stop-loss: $1.99.
