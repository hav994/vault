### Trading Plans:

**1. Ethereum (ETH):**
- **Last Price:** 4000.27 USDT
- **Entry Point:** 4000 USDT
- **Exit Point:** 4200 USDT
- **Stop Loss:** 3900 USDT
- **Trade Size:** 10% of trading capital
- **Expected Risk Ratio:** 2.5

**Rationale:** Ethereum has shown a strong trend, recently surpassing the 4000 USDT threshold. Ongoing developments within the Ethereum ecosystem and positive sentiment suggest upward momentum. The entry point at 4000 USDT provides an opportunity to capitalize on bullish trends with a manageable risk profile.

**2. XRP:**
- **Last Price:** 2.4466 USDT
- **Entry Point:** 2.40 USDT
- **Exit Point:** 2.55 USDT
- **Stop Loss:** 2.35 USDT
- **Trade Size:** 5% of trading capital
- **Expected Risk Ratio:** 2.08

**Rationale:** Despite recent declines in XRP's payment volume and concerns regarding Rippleâ€™s IPO, the current price point presents a trading opportunity given the potential for recovery and the ongoing interest in XRP. The setup allows for a reasonable risk-to-reward structure.

**3. BNB:**
- **Last Price:** 718.87 USDT
- **Entry Point:** 715 USDT
- **Exit Point:** 750 USDT
- **Stop Loss:** 700 USDT

**Rationale:** BNB has retraced below the 720 USDT mark but has maintained stability. The slight rise amidst broader market movements hints at recovery potential. The entry point allows traders to utilize the dip while setting a robust stop-loss to mitigate risk.

---

### Monitoring Strategy:
- **Risk Management:** Consistently review stop-loss levels and adjust according to market volatility. Ensure that no single trade exceeds 10% of total trading capital to maintain portfolio balance.
- **News Monitoring:** Keep a keen eye on updates regarding ADA, LINK, LUNA, SOL, BTC, and significant market events, as these can dramatically shift market sentiment and impact portfolios.
- **Performance Review:** After executing trades, monitor their performance closely, especially amid potential news releases that may affect trends. Be prepared to adjust exit points or stop-loss levels as needed to lock in profits or minimize losses.

---

**Key Takeaway:** The aim is to capitalize on current price movements while being vigilant about market news that could affect cryptocurrency valuations. This trading plan is structured to exploit upward momentum in ETH, a potential bounce-back in XRP, and stability in BNB while ensuring that proper risk management and monitoring strategies are rigorously followed.
