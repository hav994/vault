### Summary and Key Points:

- **Bitcoin** is seeing mixed signals: institutional buying by Metaplanet provides bullish support, but recent price drops and cautious futures flows suggest near-term volatility and possible pullbacks below $100K. RSI near neutral to slightly oversold supports waiting for confirmation before aggressive buying.

- **Ethereum** has suffered a sharp 10.58% drop, with RSI close to oversold, signaling high volatility and potential for a bounce but caution is warranted until signs of stabilization appear.

- **Altcoins like DOGE, SOL, and XRP** show signs of recovery and positive momentum after recent liquidations, making them candidates for short-term accumulation or trading with close monitoring of resistance levels.

- The **security incident at Cointelegraph** heightens awareness for phishing risks in the crypto space; users should be cautious on web platforms and avoid wallet connections on suspicious sites.
