**Trading Plan for Bitcoin (BTC)**  
- **Symbol:** Bitcoin (BTC)  
- **Latest Price:** $99,107.53  
- **Datetime:** 2024-12-26 01:00:00 UTC  

**Market Overview:**  
The cryptocurrency market is experiencing a holiday recovery, with Bitcoin nearing the critical level of $100,000. The optimism surrounding Bitcoin and the significant liquidation totals suggest potential price swings. However, there are safety concerns due to unauthorized token releases and market manipulation, necessitating a well-structured trading strategy that accounts for both opportunities and risks.

**Trade Strategy:**  
- **Entry Point:** Enter the market between $98,000 and $99,000. This range allows for a strategic entry just before a potential breakout above $100,000.  
- **Exit Point:** Set the exit target at $102,000, capitalizing on an estimated bounce off the $100,000 resistance level, given the current buying sentiment.  
- **Stop-Loss Level:** Implement a stop-loss at $95,500 to limit losses if the market moves against the position. This provides a safety net below the recent price fluctuations.  
- **Suggested Trade Size:** Allocate 10% of total capital to this trade, which allows for exposure while managing risk effectively according to account size and current market conditions.  
- **Risk Management Strategy:** Regularly monitor market movements, especially near the entry and stop-loss levels. Use trailing stop-losses if Bitcoin price approaches the exit point to secure profits while remaining open to potential further gains. Given the current volatility and recent liquidations, adjustments may need to be made quickly in response to market changes.

**Additional Considerations:**  
- Keep an eye on any news regarding market manipulation and unauthorized token releases, as they may influence investor sentiment rapidly.  
- Be aware of comments from key market players or regulatory developments, as ongoing tensions with authorities like the SEC can lead to increased volatility that may affect your position.  
- Watch for broader moves within related altcoins and liquidity provisioning proposals that may influence Bitcoinâ€™s overall market performance. 

This trading plan balances the potential for profit against the evident risks in the current environment, allowing for a measured approach to this bullish market trend. It is essential to remain vigilant and adapt to both market trends and sudden developments.
